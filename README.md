# User_Survey_Analysis
 A breakdown, dashboard, and analysis of survey results from the company Digital Extremes for their hit game, Warframe.

 ## Analysis
Cleaning the data for clarity and consistency of findings, I utilized power pivot to create multiple visulizations of relevent sections of the survey that could have actionable analysis done and further breakdowns into the data by cross refrencing different data sections together. Two different dashboards were created, one simply visulizing the cleaned data of the survey and another focused on further breaking down and analysising the surveyed data towards current monetization on the game, Warframe.
