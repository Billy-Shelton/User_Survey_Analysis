## Introduction 

This is my cleanup and breakdown of the 2025 user survey results that were put out by Digital Extremes, for their hit game: Warframe. I sat out to use the power of excel to clean up and present the data with excel formulas and power pivot to better target both visulization of the data and later analysis of it.

### A/B Analysis File

### Excel Skills Used

- **User Ranks**
- **Usage/engagement timeframe**
- **Engagements with various monetizations**
- **Various avenues of engagment with the game**

## Analysis

**Column Charts**

- **Design Choice:** A column chart was used to display thia data to allow for quick clarity when comparing data points against eachother. Thr further this intent, the actual numbers for each column are displayed on top to allow for immediate processing of differences. 
- **Insights Gained:** It's first interesting to see the retainment of player engagement from players that started at and before 2013, this implies the game has been consistent in content and engagement to keep these players. Another noticable insight that the chart shows is the upticks in players starting the game at large content updates that introduce new ways to engage with the game in ways not shown before. 2024 is also an interesting standout as that update had been heavily focused on themeing more related to the time period of 1999.

- **Design Choice:** I beleived a column chart was the best way to display this data, thanks to the line up of data next to eachother that provides ease of clarity to nay onlookers.
- **Insights Gained:** The Orowyrm boss is a standout and warrents further investigation, I believe, into why players feel strongly about it when compared to other boss options. H-09 and Eidolons are fairly close in postive engagment, further looking investigation into what is negativly impacting their options rom balancing out with the Orowrym could provide valuble insights for heightening the quality of content.


**Bar Charts**

- **Design Choice:** A bar chart was used for the clarity provided by the vertical display of labeling, as well as ease of showing baselines of each catogory of player. To accentuate this, the hard number of total players for each catogory was also shown at the end of the bar to identify slight differences.
- **Insights Gained:** Mastery Rank 30 is expected due to it being one of the highest ranks, meaning highly enaged players would also likely to take part in the survey. What is interesting is Master rank 17, the lowest rank of the top 10, but not bottom option. It being high supports engagement of newer players and further exploration of this grouping specifically could allow for actionable insights for future content and potential changes to the game itself.

- **Design Choice:** The bar chart supported clarity of the individual rankings of the listed options, allowing for an ease in understanding and engagement at a glance. 
- **Insights Gained:** Dante appears to be a highly wanted character, by the players, to have a deluxe skin by a wide margin when in comparion to the other options. A look into the potential cause of this popularity could warrent further investigation for actionable insights that would be applicable to other characters.


**Pie Charts**

- **Design Choice:** A pie chart was a simple and elegant way to display, with clarity, the break down in the total playerbases enjoyment of the game while keeping for consistent readability and simplicity for any viewing the chart, allowing for quick insights. 
- **Insights Gained:** Overall enjoyment and thus engagement is at, what I believe to be, acceptable levels. The lower half is kept to a minimum and indicates current changes and additions ot the game to be within expectations of both the end-player and the companies intent.

- **Design Choice:** A pie chart was chosen for it being able to accurately and simply convery the data with clarity, giving a easy to understand total percentage breakdown of the survey=takers interests in the battlepass system of Warframe. This allows for immediate insights into the overarching playerbases interests in the content by using the survey-takers as a sample group.
- **Insights Gained:** New cosemetics and gameplay effecting items appear to be the major interests of the surveyed players. That takes a particular note is the option of "other" being low but still 3% of the total group. This shows the potential for further growth of battlepass content and player interest for the potential of furthering content in this area that are outside of the consistent additions.
