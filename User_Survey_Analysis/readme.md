## Introduction 

This is my cleanup and breakdown of the 2025 user survey results that were put out by Digital Extremes, for their hit game: Warframe. I sat out to use the power of excel to clean up and present the data with excel formulas and power pivot to better target both visulization of the data and later analysis of it.

- **Design Choice:** A column chart was used to display thia data to allow for quick clarity when comparing data points against eachother. Thr further this intent, the actual numbers for each column are displayed on top to allow for immediate processing of differences. 
- **Insights Gained:** It's first interesting to see the retainment of player engagement from players that started at and before 2013, this implies the game has been consistent in content and engagement to keep these players. Another noticable insight that the chart shows is the upticks in players starting the game at large content updates that introduce new ways to engage with the game in ways not shown before. 2024 is also an interesting standout as that update had been heavily focused on themeing more related to the time period of 1999.

- **Design Choice:** I beleived a column chart was the best way to display this data, thanks to the line up of data next to eachother that provides ease of clarity to nay onlookers.
- **Insights Gained:** The Orowyrm boss is a standout and warrents further investigation, I believe, into why players feel strongly about it when compared to other boss options. H-09 and Eidolons are fairly close in postive engagment, further looking investigation into what is negativly impacting their options rom balancing out with the Orowrym could provide valuble insights for heightening the quality of content.
